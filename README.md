> AutoGo is a carpooling app built to help people share rides. AutoGo is built on the principle of less cars, less costs and less pollution. Indeed, AutoGo encourages users to carpool, meet new people and share the cost all while staying comfortable and safe.
> 
> There are 2 options that the AutoGo app provides: Create a ride and Book a ride.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to create an account, so that I can save all my information in one place
- As a user, I want to quickly find and book a ride, so that I can reach my destination early
- As a user, I want to specify the gender of the people I’m going to share my ride with, so that I feel more comfortable
- As a user, I want to find other people going to the same place as I am, so that we can split the cost between us

> This design was planned before on paper, then moved to Figma app for the fine details.
Note that i didn't use any styling library or theme, all from scratch and using pure css modules

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the AutoGo app uses:

- This project uses the [React Native app development Framework](https://reactnative.dev/). React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. It is based on React, Facebook's JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) which allows the app to create a scalable and reliable database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [expo_local_notifications](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - To get the origin and destination, the calculated travel distance and the calculated travel time, the app uses the Google Places API, the Google Directions API and the Distance Matrix API.
- The design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
